 1 - What is the suitable request method for this app: GET
or POST ? 
 answer is: get
  coz data will not send to database and data doesnt  contain password
or other sensitive information to be sent to the server 
2- How will you send the result back to the form page ? 
 passing a variable using the url
  first add a '?' to the end of the normal url 
  after the "?" add the name of the variable 
   put an "=" then add the value assigned to the variable name
 To get the value of the variable
  varName use $_GET ["varName"]
